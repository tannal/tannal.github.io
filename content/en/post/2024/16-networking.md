## History


## Kernel-space networking

- TCP/IP - The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol is the foundation of the Internet. (Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, 1974)

- UDP - The User Datagram Protocol is a simple, connectionless protocol that is used for real-time applications. (David P. Reed, 1980)

- IP - The Internet Protocol is the network layer protocol that is used to route packets on the Internet. (Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, 1974)

- Ethernet - The Ethernet protocol is the most widely used local area network protocol. (Robert Metcalfe and David Boggs, 1973)

- ARP - The Address Resolution Protocol is used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses. (David C. Plummer, 1982)

- ICMP - The Internet Control Message Protocol is used to send error messages and control messages on the Internet. (Jon Postel, 1981)

- DNS - The Domain Name System is used to translate domain names to IP addresses. (Paul Mockapetris, 1983)

- DHCP - The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is used to assign IP addresses to hosts on a network. (Ralph Droms, 1993)

- NAT - Network Address Translation is used to map private IP addresses to public IP addresses. (Masataka Ohta, 1994)

- BGP - The Border Gateway Protocol is used to route packets between autonomous systems on the Internet. (Yakov Rekhter and Kirk Lougheed, 1989)

- OSPF - The Open Shortest Path First protocol is used to route packets within an autonomous system. (John Moy, 1988)

- RIP - The Routing Information Protocol is a simple routing protocol that is used on small networks. (Charles Hedrick, 1988)

- IPsec - The Internet Protocol Security protocol is used to secure IP communications. (Steven Bellovin, John Ioannidis, and Aviel Rubin, 1994)

- SSL/TLS - The Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security protocol is used to secure web communications. (Netscape Communications, 1994)


## User-space networking
